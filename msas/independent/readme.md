The MSAs in this folder were evolved under the LG model of independent sites evolution. 

- The MSA `msas/independent/raw/10000/pevae.fa` was generated by the script found at `https://github.com/BrooksResearchGroup-UM/PEVAE_Paper/blob/master/simulated_msa/script/simulate_msa.py` with corresponding tree saved at `trees/10000/pevae.clean.tree`. 

- All other MSAs in `msas/independent/raw` were evolved with `scripts/simulate_lg_msas.sh` with corresponding trees found in `trees/fast_trees`.
