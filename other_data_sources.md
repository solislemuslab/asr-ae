# Not using so far
- For PF02033 (Ribosome-binding factor A), we download the alignment found at `aln/1josA.aln` of `http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOV/suppdata/`, which was published with the [PSICOV paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/2/184/198108). We don't have meaningful sequence labels for this family. This directory has other PFAM families, as well--also missing meaningful sequence labels.
- Phylogeny-MSATransformer/bmDCA MSAs for a bunch of PFAM families (can be found in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Bitbol-Lab/Phylogeny-MSA-Transformer/tree/main/data/Pfam_full/msa), and description of how data is obtained in Nature article section "Datasets")
